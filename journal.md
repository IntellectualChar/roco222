$ ls  
$ cd /tmp  
$ cd $HOME # what are those things starting with '$'?  
$ mkdir  
$ echo "Hello" > hello.md  
$ cat hello.md  
$ cp hello.md hello-again.md  
$ mv hello-again.md hello-hello.md  
$ rm hello.md  
$ rm -rf # be careful with that one!  
$ cat /proc/cpuinfo # is 'cpuinfo' a file??  

When we entered the code above startig with $, a message saying command not found was displayed. This is because $ is automatically placed infront of your code, so you do not have to enter it yourself. 

When removing the $ infront of the code it worked and found out the use off the following terms:

echo - write arguments to outputs
cat - read files
rm - remove
mv - move
cp - copy
